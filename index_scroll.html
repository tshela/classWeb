<p>Web Accessibility Report/Project
The project for this week will be to read the entire Overview of the article “How People with Disabilities Use the Web” and as much of it’s resources deemed necessary to finish your project, this article is located at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web/

There are 4 links to resources called:

Stories of Web Users, Diversity of Web Users, Diversity in Web Use and Accessibility Principles

Part 1) From the “Stories of Web Users” resource, pick two stories and provide a solution to a single problem the web users had, read the extra information about each story as new problems ripe for solving may be detailed in that section. I prefer that you attempt to solve an issue they might of had on the web and not issues they have with brick and mortar experiences. This may require reading through more than two stories and research the problems they had to find good solutions. 

Part 2) From the “Diversity of Web Users” resource, provide a paragraph that explains what disability in your opinion would hinder a users access to the web the most and for what reasons. In this paragraph provide one tool that you think every web developer should use 

Part 3) Using one of the pages from your existing portfolio website, create a fictitious web page for a small company. Think about the design carefully considering everything we have learned about accessibility and apply the basic rules and be creative.

Create a folder in C:\Examples\Accessibility\project and designate that as the root folder.

The minimum items should be included on the page

●	Header
●	Logo
●	Article/Section
●	Header Text 
●	Body Copy
●	Contact Info
●	Footer
<BR>
Notes: Don’t think that because we did not have you report specifically on the “Diversity in Web Use” or “Accessibility Principles” sections that you should not need to venture into them. Here you will find information on the techniques and tools that people with disabilities use to interact with the Web, such as browser settings, text-to-speech, voice recognition, and many more. Also you will find web accessibility requirements and references to the international accessibility standards from W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). These pages need to be read in order to help you find problems users are having and possibly come up with solutions to help make a more accessible web.

Tips for completion on time: Take the time allotted for this project spend ⅓ of that time just reading and taking notes. While taking notes devise a way of referencing what area of the articles your notes reference, in case you need to go back to that page later. during the ⅔ of that time you should be starting to get Part 1 and Part 2 outlined and have a rough idea of what your case will be and your solution are in some form of words, for the last ⅓ of the project allotted time you should be putting the final touches on Part  1 & Part 2 and writing your final paragraph for Part 3. You will be expected to share your paper with the class, so try to finish with enough time to read over everything.

Extra Credit: 

For extra credit you can turn your paper in with an Extra Credit Section and give a brief summary (one full paragraph) about a web accessibility podcast on The Web Ahead, a web design podcast.

In this paragraph provide one tool that you think every web developer should use in order to help make this type of persons web experience better. You may need to further research that specific disability to find out what web developers use in the way of accessibility to solve some of these problems the user might have with a modern website.
